# How to Export Data from a Project

1. **Navigate to the Data Rows Tab**  
    In your Labelbox project, open the *Data Rows* tab.

2. **Select Data to Export**  
    Choose *All* data rows, or select only the specific rows you wish to export. Click on *Export data*.

3. **Configure Export Fields**  
    Ensure all relevant fields are included in the export. You may exclude *interpolated frames* and *embeddings*, as these are not used in the dashboard and can slow down the export process.

4. **Download the Exported File**  
    Go to the *Notifications* tab and download the latest export file once it is ready.
